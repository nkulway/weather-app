Fist app I'va made with a front end framework.

I chose to make this project in vue after a friend of mine introduced me to the framework and it was really smooth and easy to understand.

The app takes live weather information from a free API and displays a temperature on the UI.

If it is hot, the background turns a deep orange/red color and if it's cold the background is a picture of snowcap mountains.
